AI Progress is now measured in **_[days](https://twitter.com/bensbitesdaily/status/1642922715924365312?s=20)_**, not years.

Artificial General Intelligence (**AGI**) is either [here](https://openai.com/product/gpt-4) ([by some accounts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12712.pdf)) or [coming very soon](https://openai.com/blog/planning-for-agi-and-beyond).

Love it, or hate it; ignore it, or shun it, or embrace it:

### The [Age of AI](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/age-ai-has-begun-bill-gates/?trackingId=SkZRGoC4RZhmP2FcgIgePg%3D%3D) is [here](https://openai.com/blog/planning-for-agi-and-beyond), yet **_nobody_** seems totally ready for it.

<br />
There are many forces which are set to play a part in the coming times. [Politics](https://davidrozado.substack.com/p/the-political-biases-of-gpt-4),
[economics](https://openai.com/research/gpts-are-gpts), sociology, information technology, and others
— yet **AGI** manages to be simultaneously the most ***unknown*** element, and the most ***transformative***
one.

<br />I have a growing mixture of concerns & hope about where I and my loved ones may fit in the new
shape of the world when this transformation is complete.

<br />
Perhaps you feel the same way.

<br />

**So let’s talk about it.**

    title={<span style={{textDecoration: 'underline', fontWeight: 'bold'}}>TL;DR for this Series</span>}
>

<b>Central Claim</b>

AIs are expected to be useful tools that reduce human cognitive load. AIs trained using state-of-the-art methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) are naturally selected for their resemblance to a specific subset of human minds. Many forces will conspire to push AGI adoption to occur in a fast, but not instantaneous, fashion — with RLHF remaining as the primary teaching mechanism for AIs. As AGI is adopted gradually, hybrid organizations will begin to form, composed of Humans, AIs, and hybrids.

<br />

<b>
  Counterintuitively, this implies that for most of us, working and living with AIs will
  increasingly require *more* skills related to traditional Human Interaction, Psychology, &
  Organizational Psychology, than it will technical skills.
</b>

<br/>
<br/>
<b><u>
<agq>AGQ</agq> is introduced as a wrapper term for these skills, consisting of:

**_<agqsk>Self-Knowledge</agqsk>_**, **_<agqok>Other-Knowledge</agqok>_**, **_<agqgk>Group-Knowledge</agqgk>_**, & **_<agqwk>World-Knowledge</agqwk>._**

</u></b>

# What is **<agq>AGQ</agq>**?

It’s a term I made up, that stands for “<agq>Ag</agq>ent <agq>Q</agq>uotient”

Am I authorized to **_make a term_**?

Nope! Sorry 🤗

<aside>
⭐ <u><agq>AGQ: Agent Quotient</agq></u>

<agq>
  One’s ability to enact change in systems composed of ***<agq>Agents</agq>*** — Humans, AIs, and
  “Hybrids” / “Cyborgs”.

<span style={{ color: 'gray' }}>
  *(We’ll unpack this in detail, so don’t be concerned if there are some unfamiliar terms)*
</span>

<agq>AGQ</agq> can be thought of as a mixture of [EQ (Emotional Quotient)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_intelligence)
and [IQ (Intelligence Quotient)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient).

Just as EQ and IQ are different ([hard-to-measure accurately](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient#Reliability_and_validity)) facets of the [idea of "G" -- or "General intelligence"](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_factor_(psychometrics)>) -- "<agq>AGQ</agq>" is a wrapper-term around the ability to interact successfully with systems which are mixtures of human and artificial agents.

<br />
Why give this a new term?
<br />

The terms we have right now aren't quite enough.

**_IQ_** isn’t quite enough — because it is focused primarily on pattern recognition, and makes no statements about an individual’s [“theory of mind”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind).

And **_EQ_** isn’t quite enough — because while it **does** cover “theory of mind”, it has focused primarily on **_human minds_**, which will soon lose their monopoly on societal participation.

<br />

As we push (or are pushed) into this brave new world, we should have **some** concept of how to behave within it. When self-improving, it’s important to have a **_target_**.

Hence, **<agq>AGQ</agq>**.

Humans are all _different_.

<br />
This has presented us with opportunities and challenges for thousands of years.
<br />
However, ***compared to AI, humans are incredibly similar***.
<br />
Pick any two humans who seem different from each-other — two political enemies, or two people from vastly
different walks-of-life. The differences between these human minds may seem stark. But the differences
between these two humans would seem ***miniscule***, if you weighed them against the differences between
either human and an AI system.

Not only will AI minds be different from our own — AI minds will be **mutually** diverse, too. There will be many different kinds of AI minds, with different strengths and weaknesses. Some of the AI minds might even become more distinct from each-other than they are from us!

<br />
But these differences ***don’t mean we should just give up hope on understanding AI systems.***

There **_are_** similarities, however small, between how AI systems perceive the world, and how we do. They **_were_** designed in our image, after all. Further, when you study AI systems, you begin to realize that there are common “subsystems” which **_all_** intelligent beings must have — human or not.

<br />
Thus despite our major differences, relating to AI will in some ways resemble how we relate to other
humans — it’s a matter of understanding where we are alike, and where we differ.

In the Age of AI, we’ll have to get comfortable interacting with **_all_** these types of minds, woven together in complex networks of **_multi-agent systems_**.

We'll all need to develop a strong [“Theory of Mind”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind), and learn how to apply the [Scientific Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method#:~:text=The%20process%20in%20the%20scientific,observations%20based%20on%20those%20predictions.)

<br />

Given this, the primary areas that I propose AGQ covers are as follows:

---

<aside>
🔑 **The Key Domains of <agq>AGQ</agq>**

1. **<agqsk>Knowledge of Yourself — _Self-Knowledge_</agqsk>**
2. **<agqok>Knowledge of Other Individuals — _Other-Knowledge_</agqok>**
3. **<agqgk>Knowledge of Groups of Individuals — _Group-Knowledge_</agqgk>**
4. **<agqwk>Knowledge of the World — _World-Knowledge_</agqwk>**

</aside>

---

The former list can be broken down even further as:

---

<aside>
🧘 **<agqsk>Self-Knowledge</agqsk>**

1. <agqsk>Noticing Patterns In your “Internal World” — thoughts, drives, & emotions</agqsk>
2. <agqsk>

   </agqsk>
3. <agqsk>Noticing Patterns in your Behavior</agqsk>

<br/>
<aside>

</agqok>
</aside>
<br/>

</agqgk>
</aside>
<br/>
<aside>

1. Ability to notice Patterns in your Environment.
2. Ability to make meaningful changes in the world.
</agqwk>

To really cover this ground, and to do it **_well_** — we’ll need to explore a little bit of how our minds work, how AI minds work, how groups work, and how the world works.

We'll of course need to study State-of-the-Art AI systems, both to understand "who we're creating", but also as a means of understanding more about ourselves. (<i style={{color: 'gray'}}>& also because they're cool</i> 🤓)

We'll need to learn some things about Psychology, both in individuals and in groups. We'll need to touch on topics around Cultural Development, Game Theory, & Decision Theory.

Taking all of the acquired knowledge and stretching it to the limit, we'll need to zoom out and look at the Social & Macroeconomic landscape -- to predict how the developments in AI will fit within the world we inhabit today, and exactly how much they'll change it.

<br />

Easy, right? 😉

<br />

I won’t claim that I’ll be able to do all of these justice, but at least it'll be a fun conversation.

🎭 In <u>**Part 2: “Characters”**</u>, we’ll go over some of the characters we should expect to see in the near future. We’ll review some state-of-the-art research, and couple it with our intuitions about ***human minds*** to develop an intuition around ***AI minds.***

🕸 In <u>**Part 3: “Cyborganizations”**</u>, we’ll talk about how these characters will interact to create emergent social structures — from small groups, to major organizations.

🛠 In <u>**Parts 4-7: “Skills”**</u>, we’ll explore the specific skills we should be investing in to prepare for the future we’ve laid out: **_<agqsk>Self-Knowledge</agqsk>, <agqok>Other-Knowledge</agqok>, <agqgk>Group-Knowledge</agqgk>, <agqwk>World-Knowledge</agqwk>_**

🌌 In <u>**Part 8: “Epilogue”**</u>, we’ll talk about how this all ties together.
