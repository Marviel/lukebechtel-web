    Why do I care about this?
    
    - The Cognitive Sciences are fascinating, and some of the last great frontiers of science ‚Äî Psychology, Machine Learning, Computer Science, Sociology, et. al.
    - It‚Äôs very hard to setup good large-scale psychological studies. Machine Learning gives us low-confidence, but high-throughput tests of basic assumptions about human psychology.
    - Most of us know we can "be better", but we're not quite sure how.
    - To give people exposure to some Machine Learning concepts. Machine Learning can be hard to understand, but all of us are familiar with humans, and (to some extent) with ourselves.

<aside>
üí° Welcome! In this post, we discuss curiosity, why it‚Äôs desirable, how it‚Äôs been emulated in machines, and how we can apply those techniques to ourselves.

This is the first in my ***Learning from Machines*** series ‚Äî where we study machines to be better humans.

# Curiosity

Who is the most generally curious person you know?

Think about it for a moment.

We‚Äôre looking for someone who will jump at the chance to learn new information ‚Äî of any kind.

Got it? Ok.

I‚Äôd bet some money that the most curious person you know also has quite a few of these traits:

- They‚Äôre interesting to be around ‚Äî rarely a dull moment.
- They‚Äôre open-minded ‚Äî almost always willing to hear someone out.
- They have many friends, from different walks of life.
- They‚Äôre pretty funny.

As children, we‚Äôre incredibly curious. But when we become adults, we are more cautious about trying new approaches & perspectives, because they often have real world consequences.

What is talking to that person like? I bet they have a lot of 

Curiosity, is often categorized as an "innate character trait". Most people, if they consider it at all, seem to believe that curiosity is a mystical "you-have-it-or-you-don't" quality. The word can even be used in a derogatory sense ‚Äî ‚Äúthey‚Äôre a curious person‚Äù isn‚Äôt always a compliment.  Indeed, most people don't seem to see the *value* in curiosity ‚Üí "Curiosity killed the cat," the old saying goes.

If curiosity is only luck of the draw, that kind of ***sucks***. Because it turns out it's really important. Just ask Albert:

> I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious.
- Albert Einstein
> 

Many studies (with varying degrees of rigor) have found that curiosity is an important trait in successful individuals and groups. My personal experience has taught me that curiosity is vital for my personal development. My intuition also tells me that curiosity is probably a core part of empathy.

And the world could use a lot more empathy!

## Conjuring Curiosity: Part 1

So, if I haven‚Äôt convinced you ‚Äî let‚Äôs just *assume* that curiosity matters, and ask 

<aside>
‚ùì **How can we become curious?**

</aside>

Let's look at the word's definition:

> **cu¬∑ri¬∑os¬∑i¬∑ty
/ÀåkyoÕùorƒìÀà√§s…ôdƒì/
1.
a strong desire to know or learn something.**
> 

‚Ä¶ which raises the question:

> ü§î¬†You: **How do we cultivate a strong desire if we don't possess it?**

I‚Äôm glad you asked üôÇ

Let‚Äôs start with a video:

[https://youtu.be/40VZeFppDEM](https://youtu.be/40VZeFppDEM)

Let‚Äôs talk about it, from the perspective of how we‚Äôve taught machines to be curious.

This is from OpenAI's paper, *[Large-Scale Study of Curiosity-Driven Learning (by Burda et. al., via arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.04355.pdf)*. In this experiment, they trained a Reinforcement Learning agent to "seek curiosity" ‚Äî and it paid off; their agent was able to go from *tabula rasa* ‚Äî a state of "no knowledge" ‚Äî to the ability to solve some of the hardest atari-style games. I highly recommend reading [this blog post](https://openai.com/blog/reinforcement-learning-with-prediction-based-rewards/) by OpenAI, which visualizes and explains the results, in OpenAI's tidy, accessible style. Here's a cool video from their post, to tempt you into checking it out:

Right off the bat, the abstract of the paper tells you most of what you need to know to get your gears turning, albeit in the parlance of Machine Learning, and not human-speak:

> ... Curiosity is a type of intrinsic
reward function which uses prediction error as reward signal.
> 

Many ML abstractions are beautiful, but I find this a particularly elegant and easily translatable description of the human quality it's trying to emulate.

To translate this from the Machine Learning to the Human world:

<aside>
üí° To be curious, we should reward ourselves for acting in ways that produce hard to predict outcomes.

</aside>

This boldly suggests that the idea of curiosity is all about ***the inability to predict what is going to happen next***. And indeed, checking in with my intuition, this *feels* right to some degree.

### Putting it into Human Practice: Attempt 1

That's all a nice and tidy thought. But "does it scale"? How might this work in practice?

Let's say I'm sitting at my desk, as I am now, and I've decided I want to be curious. If I want to seek out things that are incredibly hard to predict, and random, the first place I might think to look as a person would be Reddit, specifically, [reddit.com/r/all](http://reddit.com/r/all).There are *All Kinds* of things on there, and with the exception of a few very homogenous communities, I have *no idea* what's going to come next.

Maybe the key, then, is to pick a *Domain*. And try to "be curious" within the context of this domain. For example:

TODO example of how this might be used as it sits. Quickly realizing that it doesn't quite work.

Difficulties

- Randomly Flailing your Arms
    - Isn't flailing about wildly technically hard to predict?
        - In some sense, yes ‚Äî flailing your arms about wildly is hard to predict, in the sense that your immediate physical positions are not easy to predict. However, If one is flailing about wildly ‚Äî then in some sense your behavior is easy to predict ‚Äî you're just...flailing about wildly.
- Distraction
- Procrastination

So maybe we've had this idea wrong all along ‚Äî it isn't that some of us ***aren't curious*** ‚Äî  it turns out that *all of us are* *already* *insanely curious!* **We just need to learn how to redirect that innate curiosity**.

So maybe the name of this post should be:

> Learning From Machines: ~~Conjured~~ *Directed* Curiosity
> 

## ~~Conjuring~~ *Directing* Curiosity: Part 2

<aside>
‚ùì How can we direct our curiosity?

</aside>

If we're innately curious, how do we direct that Curiosity?

It ends up that DeepMind (that company that solved the game of go, which I've recently been learning) has thought about this quite a bit.

> We propose a new curiosity method which uses episodic memory to form the novelty bonus. To determine the bonus, the current observation
is compared with the observations in memory. Crucially, the comparison is done
based on how many environment steps it takes to reach the current observation
from those in memory ‚Äî which incorporates rich information about environment
dynamics. This allows us to overcome the known ‚Äúcouch-potato‚Äù issues of prior
work ‚Äî when the agent finds a way to instantly gratify itself by exploiting actions
which lead to hardly predictable consequences.

This might *still* be unclear, so perhaps we should strip it down to a simple example:

## Directing Curiosity: Part 3

# TL;DR

1. Curiosity is important
2. We are innately curious, but do not always channel our curiosity in beneficial directions.
3. Curiosity is learnable with practice.
4. To practice curiosity, seek situations which are both ***unfamiliar*** and ***hard to predict***.
